## Feature Highlights

### Granular File Permissions

Restrict which files an agent can edit using glob patterns:

```jsonc
{
  "agent": {
    "plan": {
      "permission": {
        "edit": {
          "**/*.md": "allow",
          "CONTEXT/**": "allow",
          "*": "deny",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Precedence rules: exact match > more path segments > longer pattern > `*` fallback

### Agents

OpenCode includes two built-in agents you can switch between,
you can switch between these using the `Tab` key.

- **build** - Default, full access agent for development work
- **plan** - Read-only agent for analysis and code exploration
  - Denies file edits by default
  - Asks permission before running bash commands
  - Ideal for exploring unfamiliar codebases or planning changes

Also, included is a **general** subagent for complex searches and multi-step tasks.
This is used internally and can be invoked using `@general` in messages.

### Building on OpenCode

If you are working on a project that's related to OpenCode and is using "opencode" as a part of its name; for example, "opencode-dashboard" or "opencode-mobile", please add a note to your README to clarify that it is not built by the OpenCode team and is not affiliated with us in anyway.

### FAQ

#### How is this different than Claude Code?

It's very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:

- 100% open source
- Not coupled to any provider. Although we recommend the models we provide through [OpenCode Zen](https://opencode.ai/zen); OpenCode can be used with Claude, OpenAI, Google or even local models. As models evolve the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop so being provider-agnostic is important.
- Out of the box LSP support
- A focus on TUI. OpenCode is built by neovim users and the creators of [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop); we are going to push the limits of what's possible in the terminal.
- A client/server architecture. This for example can allow OpenCode to run on your computer, while you can drive it remotely from a mobile app. Meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.

#### What's the other repo?

The other confusingly named repo has no relation to this one. You can [read the story behind it here](https://x.com/thdxr/status/1933561254481666466).
